# Mobile App Development Course Lab Files

- Welcome to the repository for your Mobile App Development (MAD) course lab files! 
- This repository contains all the exercises, tasks, and practice files for my MAD course.
- Each lab session is organized into separate directories, making it easy to navigate and find the relevant materials.

Each lab session is represented by a directory (`Lab-1`, `Lab-2`, etc.), and within each lab directory, you'll find subdirectories for individual tasks (`Task-1`, `Task-2`, etc.).
